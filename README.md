# Career Day

This is a presentation for an elemtary school Career Day.  The idea is to step through some basic concepts of Software Engineering and pull back the curtain a little bit on what goes into a web page.

## Notes about the repo

The information shared on the welcome page about this wonder field of Software Engineering is oversimplified to talk to elementary school students.  I may still talk over their heads, but I'm hoping to inspire the kids who would be interested in writing software.

This app was a bit rushed, because I mostly worked on it the day before I presented, but things have been a little hectic at work.  The view-side is the most concerning, but as a back-end engineer it's a bit more tedious to me and I'm happy to have something presentable so quickly.

I use https://pokeapi.co/ to get some data.  I wanted to pull the pokemon images as I need them and cache them for the future, but I ended up fighting the asset pipeline.  So I used those methods in the command line to cache the pokemon information (internet may not even be good when I'm presenting).  I left the methods I used in the repo because if I do this again I can maybe re-engineer them or if somebody ever wants to copy this, they can use what I have there.
